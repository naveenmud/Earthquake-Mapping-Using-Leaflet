![1-BasicMap](Leaflet-Step-1/Images/1-BasicMap.png)


The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. 

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. This project will to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations on issues facing our planet.
